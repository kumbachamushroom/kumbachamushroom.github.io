Hi there, my name is Lucas and I'm thrilled that you're here! I'm currently completing my Master's degree in Computer Engineering at the North-West University in Potchefstroom, South Africa. My main focus is artificial intelligence, deep learning and specifically natural language processing but I blog about anything that I find interesting. I'm also part of the [MuST research group](http://engineering.nwu.ac.za/multilingual-speech-technologies-must/research-projects) which is a South African based research group and we're doing some real groundbreaking work, you should check us out.

This is my personal blog where I hope to share my knowledge, experience and ideas with the world.
